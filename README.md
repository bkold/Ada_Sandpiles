##About
This program is written with Ada2012 and requires a Ada2012 GNAT compiler. Also required is an installation of FreeImage for your version of GCC.

##Installation and Run

Installation is very simple. Once FreeImage and Gnat are installed, simply run gprbuild. The input argument needs to be a multiple of 4 and the grid size needs to be a multiple of 16. Eventhough this is as efficient as I could make it, it took my computer 3 1/2 hours to make the above picture.
